# 🌊 Ripple Effect – Water Simulation in Computer Graphics

## 📌 Overview
Ripple Effect is a computer graphics project that simulates water ripple patterns when an object interacts with a virtual surface. It uses wave equations and damping models to render natural-looking ripple animations. This project was selected as a semifinalist at **Code Unnati Innovation Marathon 3.0**.
